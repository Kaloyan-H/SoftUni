                Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
                Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
                feeling that you can become great too.

                Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
                self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the
                best of which you are capable.
